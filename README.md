This project aims to reconstruct cell electrode in 3D based on certain contour extraction (ex. for cylindrical cell, the contour would be a (deformed) spiral). It aims to provide advance viewer to study the spatial correlation of defect in the cell.  

It would require full length stitch image of electrode as the input as well as contours along the height of the cell.  

To play, run contourfitting.py
